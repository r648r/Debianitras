## Overview

This toolkit provides various utilities for security professionals conducting assessments, threat intelligence, and forensic analysis. The tools can be used independently or as part of an integrated workflow.

## Tools

### DAMN - Digital Asset Mapping and Network Analyzer

A network scanning tool for identifying and analyzing digital assets across networks, helping security professionals map infrastructure and discover potential vulnerabilities.

#### Features:

- IP and port scanning with multithreaded execution
- Support for various target formats (IP addresses, ranges, CIDR notation)
- Service detection and version identification
- Optional Nmap integration for enhanced scanning
- Vulnerability detection for common exposed services
- Comprehensive JSON reporting
- Terminal output with color-coded results

#### Usage:

```bash
# Basic scan of a specific target
python damn.py -t 192.168.1.1 -o scan_results.json

# Scan multiple targets on specific ports
python damn.py -t 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2,example.com -p 22,80,443 -o network_scan.json

# Scan a network range
python damn.py -t 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22-25,80,443,3389 --timeout 2 --threads 50
```

### Dork - Google Dork Search Tool

A command-line utility for automating Google dork searches, which are specialized search queries that can reveal sensitive information exposed on websites.

#### Features:

- Execute Google dork queries from the command line
- Specify the number of results to retrieve
- Save results to a text file
- Automatic logging of search results in JSON format
- Colorized terminal output

#### Usage:

```bash
python dork.py -d "site:example.com filetype:pdf" -n 100 -o results.txt
```

### Find-SensitiveFiles - Sensitive File Detection

A PowerShell script that scans systems for potentially sensitive files based on various detection patterns, helping identify security risks or data exposures.

#### Features:

- Comprehensive file detection for 30+ sensitive file types
- Detection based on file name, extension, and content patterns
- Content scanning with support for common configuration files
- Recursive directory scanning
- Detailed reporting with file metadata
- CSV export functionality
- Hidden file detection
- Quick mode for rapid assessments

#### Usage:

```powershell
# Basic scan of C: drive
.\Find-SensitiveFiles.ps1 -Paths "C:\" -OutputFile "SensitiveFiles.csv"

# Quick scan without content inspection
.\Find-SensitiveFiles.ps1 -Paths "C:\Users", "D:\Data" -IncludeContent:$false

# Full scan including hidden files with detailed output
.\Find-SensitiveFiles.ps1 -Paths "C:\Users\Administrator" -CheckHidden -OutputFile "AdminScan.csv"
```

### DeepSeek Translator - Technical Translation

An advanced tool for translating and analyzing cybersecurity content using the DeepSeek API, with features for emotion analysis, technical term extraction, and context analysis.

#### Features:

- Multi-language technical translation
- Emotion and sentiment analysis
- Technical term extraction and definition
- Tag categorization for messages
- Context-aware message analysis
- Handling of truncated messages
- Multithreaded processing for performance
- Detailed metrics and statistics

#### Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python ds.py -j messages.json -a "your-api-key" -o translated_output.json

# Advanced usage with turbo mode
python ds.py -j messages.json -a "your-api-key" -m turbo -w 8 -b 20 -c 10 -o translated_output.json
```

### Merge - JSON Merger

A utility script for merging JSON outputs from DeepSeek Translator and other tools.

#### Features:

- Merges two JSON files based on object IDs
- Generates statistical reports about the merge operation
- Preserves all data from both sources
- Handles duplicate entries

#### Usage:

```bash
python merge.py deepseek_output.json ultraflower_colored.json merged_output.json
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- PowerShell 5.1+ (for Find-SensitiveFiles)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-tools.git
   cd cybersecurity-tools
   ```

2. Install required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Integrated Workflow Example

1. **Gather potential targets using Dork:**
   ```bash
   python dork.py -d "inurl:admin filetype:php" -n 200 -o potential_targets.txt
   ```

2. **Scan a system for sensitive files:**
   ```powershell
   .\Find-SensitiveFiles.ps1 -Paths "C:\webroot" -OutputFile "sensitive_scan.csv"
   ```

3. **Translate and analyze technical conversations:**
   ```bash
   python ds.py -j chat_logs.json -a "your-api-key" -o translated_logs.json
   ```

4. **Merge analysis results:**
   ```bash
   python merge.py translated_logs.json additional_analysis.json final_report.json
   ```
